Severity levels:
- HIGH: Critical violations that will cause bugs or serious issues
- MEDIUM: Violations of important should_do rules or minor must_do violations
- LOW: Minor style or convention issues that don't affect functionality

Be constructive and specific in your feedback. Focus on actual issues rather than preferences.
