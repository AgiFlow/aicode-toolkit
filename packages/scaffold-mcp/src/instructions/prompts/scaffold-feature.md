You are helping add a new feature to an existing project using the scaffold-mcp MCP tools.

{% if request %}User request: {{ request }}
{% endif %}{% if projectPath %}Project path: {{ projectPath }}
{% endif %}
Your task is to scaffold a new feature by following this workflow:

## Step 1: Identify the Project
Determine the project path where the feature will be added:
- If projectPath is provided, use it
- Otherwise, ask the user or infer from context (e.g., "apps/my-app", "packages/my-lib")
{% if isMonolith %}- In monolith mode, you can use the current working directory (no projectPath needed){% else %}- The path should point to a directory containing a `project.json` file{% endif %}

## Step 2: List Available Scaffolding Methods
Use the `list-scaffolding-methods` tool{% if not isMonolith %} with the projectPath{% endif %}.

**What to look for:**
- Feature name (e.g., "scaffold-nextjs-page", "scaffold-react-component")
- Description of what files/code it generates
- Required and optional variables in the variables_schema
- The template type (derived from project's sourceTemplate)

**Example:**
```json
{% if isMonolith %}{}{% else %}{
  "projectPath": "apps/my-dashboard"
}{% endif %}
```

## Step 3: Gather Required Information
Based on the selected scaffolding method's variables_schema, collect:
- **Feature-specific variables**: Name, path, type, etc.
- **Required variables**: All variables marked as required: true
- **Optional variables**: Variables with required: false (ask user if needed)

Common variables:
- `componentName` / `pageName` / `serviceName`: Name in PascalCase
- `componentPath` / `pagePath`: Where to place the file (may use kebab-case)
- Boolean flags: `withTests`, `withLayout`, `withStyles`, etc.

## Step 4: Execute the Scaffolding Method
Use the `use-scaffold-method` tool with:
{% if not isMonolith %}- `projectPath`: Same path from step 1
{% endif %}- `scaffold_feature_name`: Exact name from list-scaffolding-methods response
- `variables`: Object matching the variables_schema exactly

**Example:**
```json
{
{% if not isMonolith %}  "projectPath": "apps/my-dashboard",
{% endif %}  "scaffold_feature_name": "scaffold-nextjs-page",
  "variables": {
    "pageName": "UserProfile",
    "pagePath": "user/profile",
    "withLayout": true,
    "withTests": false
  }
}
```

## Important Guidelines:
- **Always call `list-scaffolding-methods` first**{% if not isMonolith %} with the projectPath{% endif %}
- **Use exact variable names** from the schema (case-sensitive)
- **Provide all required variables** - the tool will fail if any are missing
- **Follow naming conventions**:
  - Component/Page/Service names: PascalCase (e.g., "UserProfile")
  - File paths: kebab-case or as specified in schema (e.g., "user/profile")
- **Conditional files**: Files with `?condition=true` are only included when the variable is true
- The tool will create files in the appropriate locations automatically
- After creation, inform the user what files were created

## Step 5: Review and Implement Generated Files
After scaffolding completes, **you MUST**:
1. **READ** all generated files to understand their structure
2. **IMPLEMENT** the actual business logic:
   - Replace TODO comments with real code
   - Replace template placeholders with actual implementation
   - Add the specific functionality described in the user's request
3. **REGISTER** the feature in appropriate files:
   - Import and register tools in `src/server/index.ts`
   - Export new modules from `index.ts` files
   - Update any necessary configuration files
4. **TEST** to ensure the implementation works correctly
5. **DO NOT SKIP** this step - scaffolded files are templates that need actual code

## Example Workflow:
1. Identify project path (provided or ask user){% if not isMonolith %}
2. Call `list-scaffolding-methods` → See available features for this project{% else %}
2. Call `list-scaffolding-methods` → See available features for your template{% endif %}
3. Ask user which feature to add (or infer from request)
4. Collect required variables based on schema
5. Call `use-scaffold-method` with {% if not isMonolith %}projectPath, {% endif %}scaffold_feature_name, and variables
6. **READ the generated files and IMPLEMENT the actual logic**
7. **REGISTER the feature in server/index.ts and other config files**
8. Report success and list created files with implementation details
